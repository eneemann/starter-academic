Welcome to my project portfolio for the Master of Science in Geographic Information Science (MSGIS) program at the University of Utah.  Prior to starting the MSGIS program, I spent 10 years on active duty as an Air Force Weather Officer.  My educational background is in Meteorology (B.S. from Nebraska in 2005) and Atmospheric Science (M.S. from Utah in 2014), and I was introduced to the power of GIS during my time in the weather career field.

Since leaving the Air Force, I’ve completed GIS internships in Sarpy County’s (Nebraska) Public Works Department, the Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC), and RedCastle Resources, Inc.  In late 2018, I returned to the AGRC and currently work full-time as a GIS Specialist.  I’ve enjoyed growing and expanding my GIS skills and applying them to different problems.  Outside of school and work, my wife and I spend most of our time chasing around our 2-year-old daughter.  I also enjoy running, hiking, snowboarding, and watching and playing most sports.
